So it's understandable but as a consumer I would prefer big companies with their insurance policies so I think that is my choice. - Well, I think it's better to live it to work in a big company because in big companies you have a bigger platform. You have chances to learn from people who came before you, who were also working in the company. You have chances to work across companies because you have a lot of business dealing with them.
