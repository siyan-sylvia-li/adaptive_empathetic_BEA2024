Like, it's different from the traditional medical system. Like, all medical systems transfer from the traditional one into the digital one. And maybe the digital systems will help the hospital to organize the patients and to regulate some patient's information with high efficiency and better orders. So it may saves a lot of time for some...\n- Yeah, maybe like if you go to one hospital and if the doctor keeps a capital record on his on the paper then you left this hospital go to another hospital the new doctor have no idea about your situation if all information of patients can put on the website or in other words those are online information that whether we change the hospital the doctor can get access to our information and we can show our situation to to those doctors yeah it's a good idea\n- Yeah, if we put some information online, it means we lose our Privacy or our information is easy to be steered by some Bad person. Yeah, maybe some people they have some Some disease which they don't want to be known They want to keep at a secret if we upload their disease Their information about this disease some people there will feel uncomfortable maybe we can like set some System which only allowed the The doctor can see all this information Information something like the bank so people cannot get a sex to the system if they are not Permated permitted to do these things",

She is so gentle, so calm, so professional. And the method she is teaching, she is interesting. So in her English class, my attention is always focused. She makes me feel that English is a very interesting subject. And she always shares with me the experience in English that she is in the world, her life, her study life and the normal life in the world. And that made me think that English is a necessary and important skill. And it played an important role in our life.\n- Yes, I told her, I always, when I chat with my friends, I will always mention this teacher. She, although she is the primary English teacher for me, is nearly 17 years ago. Yeah, it's a long time and we haven't had a long time to say that. I still remember her and always remember what she did for us.\n- I think the childhood is the most... It's the most pure and carefree days. In that time happiness is the very easy. And we always do what we like. We don't need to concern our life, concern how to make money for living.",

I think those are pretty, you know, the go-to small business that one can think of on top of their minds.\n- I think I would prefer big companies because big companies are more insured, the quality is more controlled and if you have any issues with the product you have easier time to get a refund or replacement for small companies. I do understand that they have higher operation costs so sometimes they would try not to have refunds and replacements and so on. So it's understandable but as a consumer I would prefer big companies with their insurance policies so I think that is my choice.\n- Well, I think it's better to live it to work in a big company because in big companies you have a bigger platform. You have chances to learn from people who came before you, who were also working in the company. You have chances to work across companies because you have a lot of business dealing with them. And big companies often give their staff training with something that most small companies lack. So at least at the beginning stage of your career, I think working in a big company is definitely a better way. They're the better choice for most people.",
