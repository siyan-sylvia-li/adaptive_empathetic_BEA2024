Not every country can afford that.\n- No, I don't think the government has the responsibility to do so.", "- Mostly I love all of them but sometimes you know the wireless Bluetooth earphones can be a bit annoying because in some cases I fail to connect them with my phone so that's what I can think of by now.\n- I guess that it has completely changed my life. I mean everyone's life. So in the past the phones were not smartphones so it just had some basic functions like messaging or phoning. But nowadays it's a totally different picture. It's so great. I guess that phones have evolved into a super tool.\n- Yeah, I've seen lots of small business in my city and mostly some closing stores or some stores at the market selling fresh produce like meat and veggies. That's basically the small business in or near my community.", "- For species animals, I think it needs to set up natural supplies. It can be good with them and protect them well.\n- Yes, every day, because I live in a country, so I can see the farm around my house.\n- maybe four of vegetables and some fruits, cheese.

And even if you're good to the other cities, which is not too often in my case, the Zeus oftentimes won't be the first choice. And that's also the case if you're good to the big cities, if you go to a smaller cities or the countryside or just want to go to a remote place to see the landscapes, then it's unlikely that you will go to Zeus. So overall, people have the less tendency to go to Zeus, so it's not that often I would say overall on average for the general population.\n- And for the Visiting Zoo Museum is that you can understand, you can gain more knowledge about the animals, a variety of kinds of animals, and you can see that we as humans actually live a much different life than these animals, which in tens of thousands or millions of years ago, which is not too many years over the span of the Earth or over the span of the entire universe, you can see that many, many years ago we probably all lived in the wild and have to experience the life without much organization, without much purpose, but now we live such a different life and you can see a different perspective from how the Mother Earth involves and how randomness actually in fact can make an impact on how different things live in different lives.\n- Sorry, could you tell again?", "- Okay, the idea house I would like to have is a modern minimalist villa located on a seaside cliff overlooking the ocean. It's a dream that I've had for years and one that I hope to make a reality one day. The house itself would be sleek and contemporary with clean lines and large open windows to take in beautiful views. It would have a spacious living room with comfortable seating and a cozy fireplace to curl up next to on coat winter nights. The bedrooms would be large and ivory with plenty of natural light and high-quality bang for restful nights. One of the main special features of my idea house would be a standing infinity pool that seems to extend right into the ocean. I can imagine spending hours floating in the pool and joining the sunshine and the salty sea breeze. The house would also have a large outdoor deck perfect for entertaining guests or just enjoying a quiet breakfast in the mornings. Another special feature would be a state-of-the-art home. Theater system where I could watch my favorite movies or binge watch my favorite TV shows in comfortable and style. The reason why this is my idea house is because I love the ocean and the feeling of being surrounded by nature. I also appreciate modern architecture and the minimalist ecstasy which I find both soothing and inspiring. Having a space like this would allow me to truly relax and recharge and I think it would be the perfect\n- No, I haven't. Oh, maybe yes, I can't remember it very well.\n- You can find a diverse range of architectural styles that reflect the country's rich history and cultural heritage. One of the most common architectural styles in China is traditional Chinese architecture.

Especially during hot summer days, I enjoy trying different flavors and toppings. And find that it always brings a smile to my face.\n- I eat ice cream occasionally but not a lot.

That's basically the small business in or near my community.\n- Well, that depends. I mean, it depends on what I'm looking for or what I need. If I'm going to buy a phone, for example, I would definitely choose big companies because the quality of the product can be reliable. In some other cases, if it's just a small stuff, I guess that buying it from a small business can be a very good choice.\n- Oh, working for big ones or small ones may all have their own merits. I mean, if you work for a big company, you get a better career development plan, a clear career path. Maybe your colleagues or leaders are very senior and they can be so inspiring. So, working for a small company on the other hand, maybe you can maximize your potential and creativity. Yeah, that's the strong point of working for a small company.", "- Yes, I pretty much like the art galleries because I like the atmosphere of that. It's quiet and so peaceful. I think most art galleries are quite inspiring for me to visit and I can learn so many things about culture and history.\n- Well, I think it's quite romantic for someone to dream to be an artist, but for me I am not planning to be an artist. First of all, it is quite hard to be a qualified artist and for me I am not talented to do that job. The second reason is that for the career issues it is also more difficult for an artist to earn a lot of money, that is to say.\n- Personally, I prefer traditional art because some modern arts are quite obscure to me. At least, art, for me to understand what the creator is trying to express through their art pieces. But the traditional style of art, for me, they are easier for me to understand.", "- I mean, for example, you see classical music has a pattern of sounds made by traditional musical instruments. Electronic music, on the other hand, contains human voices or computers or just a combination of these. So each type of music intends to give pleasure to people. So that's why I find them so engaging.\n- Oh, I would say it's definitely pop music. I mean, it's called pop music for a reason, right? As a type of modern popular music, it usually comes with a strong beat and created with the electronic or electronic equipment and it's easy to listen to and remember. So that's why it can be hugely popular in my country.\n- There are many singers and musicians I would love to see in person, but if I had to choose one, I guess it would be at sharing. I'm a big fan of him and his music, of course, and I admire his ability to connect with his audience through his lyrics and performances. So I think it's going to be an amazing experience to see him in person.", "- Well, I think AI is definitely big in healthcare. Computer vision will play a very important role in detecting diseases. And general AI technologies will help doctors and even patients to understand, based on the information that they have, what kind of diseases they have, what kind of suggestions or device they should take. And in terms of developing new medicines, I think artificial intelligence will play a big role in really accelerating the pace of new drug discovery, instead of having to trial, having to do trials one by one in the past.\n- Personally, I think as long as it's accurate, as long as it's safe, and as long as it can save human cost, because we, the doctors and patients, doctors have limited amount of time, patients, they also have limited amount of time and limited amount of budget. So I think with the help of AI, we really can really benefit everyone to maximize the health and well-being of human beings.\n- Yeah, I definitely heard there are a lot of new investments and new frontiers in developing new drugs using AI in terms of doing trials. And also, I think now the AI, the computer vision technology is already in use for assistance to doctors in terms of whether there is like a tumor in your lungs. And that's definitely very helpful in like that's adding additional AI to the doctor's eyes and it's beneficial.", "- Well, I think dark chocolate because they were not too sweet and it's also very tasty.\n- Well, I think it depends on who you were actually trying to give this present to. If it's a girlfriend or if it's your best friend. Okay, so I think it's okay, but if you were trying to give chocolate to people like parents, grandparents, I don't think it's quite suitable.\n- Well, I don't think so. At least most flavors were not good for your health. Well, because chocolate, as far as I know, is full of sugar and it's quite high in calories. So, well, like, especially for girls, if you eat a lot of chocolate, you'll go fat very easily.", "- I have never returned to see my own school again.

To be honest, I can't understand the traditional arts, what's mean.", "- Oh, why? I don't play with toys. I play a lot of video games.\n- No, I don't think so because you're gonna spoil them. Children, they cannot tell right from wrong. If they want something, they just want to get it. So if you give them what they want, give them as many toys as possible, it's gonna spoil them.\n- Yeah, I do.

I have to say that China is quite big. You have to divide it into different parts.

But as for students in smaller cities, like just like my hometown, they don't have a chance to visit these kind of facilities like the library.\n- Well, as for my college in my university, I guess that there aren't enough desks and the air condition isn't so enough for students to enjoy the environment and to just dive into their study. So I think the air condition and the desks are definitely the two points that can be improved.\n- Talking about the reason I guess that, I guess the reason is that the school, the university, I came to wasn't so rich. They don't, they didn't have that much fund.

Well, people, when you talk about technology and their lives, people think about, you know, more people think about computers, phones, but it's been true, you know, ever since the dawn of humanity, right? At the early stages of humanity, people farm is actually a new form of technology, you know, using plows, new form of technology, using no oil lamps is a new form I mean, if you see technologies a broad sense, everything has come down to technology, that's what separates us from, you know, animals and what makes us a civilization.\n- social media for starters, especially not like the algorithm. So as I've said before, it is feeding information that you already know and you already agree with.

I tend to stick with one bag for a while until it starts to wear out, or until I find a new one that I really like. I think it's important to invest in a good quality bag that can last for a long time rather than constantly buying new ones.\n- When traveling, I usually use a backpack or a small suitcase with wheels. A backpack is great for exploring a new city or going on a hike, as it's easy to carry and allows me to keep my hands free.

If it's just a little gadget that you just use for a little while and it's cheap, then it really doesn't matter whether it's buy it from a big company or small one. For an important and expensive purchase, I tend to trust big companies more because they have a reputation and they generally also have better customer services.\n- Both have advantages and disadvantages obviously. Small companies tend to be more flexible and there are a lot of things you can try in a small team and they tend to be more personal and close-knit. The big companies tend to be more stable and they have a bigger platform and more resources. There's more vertical space for you to develop your own portfolio or career development.

Maybe we can have a chat for this book. But if my friend don't like this book or it's not interesting in this book, now I can't share my feelings. I'll be reading this books for my friend.\n- Because you know in this world people catch the information, I already but the book is very old, the information is coming.

Instead, I prefer to channel my creativity in other ways, such as writing or photography. That being said, I have the utmost respect for those who pursue a career in arts and admire their ability to convey complex emotions and ideas through their work.\n- As someone who loves art, I enjoy both traditional and modern forms of it. I think that traditional art, such as classical painting or sculptures, often have a timeless quality and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. On the other hand, modern art can be exciting and thought-provoking precisely because it challenges our preconceived notions of what art is and can be.\n- One activity that I absolutely loved doing in my free time when I was young was reading books. I was an avid reader and would often spend hours immersed in a good book. I would read books at home in the library or at a quiet coffee shop. And my favorite place to read, however, was in the cozy corner in my bedroom, where I had a comfortable armchair, a soft blanket, and a lamp for reading at night. I usually read alone, but sometimes my friends and I would exchange books and discuss our opinions about the characters and the storyline. It was a great way to share our love of reading and learn more about different genres and authors. I loved reading because it allowed me to escape reality and entering into different worlds and perspectives. I could travel to far off lands, meet interesting characters, and experience different cultures, all from the comfort of my own home. Reading also enhanced my imagination, vocabulary, and critical thinking skills, which proved beneficial later on in my life. Furthermore, reading was a fantastic stress reliever for me. It was a calming and peaceful activity that allowed me to unwind and clear my mind after a busy day at school. Overall, reading was a beloved activity for me when I was young. It was a way to learn, grow, and relax all at the same time.", "- Well, it really depends. I mean, it depends on parents thinking it. And if they can ensure that the children can have an environment where they or she can cook safely, then of course, the parents can go ahead and teach their child how to cook. And there's never a definitively appropriate age. But if I had to give a ballpark, I would say after age eight, children should be able to have enough power to use the utensils to cook. And of course, parents will watch with the watchful eyes and not\n- Why do I think so? That's a repetitive question, I think. I just think, I mean, after eight years old, I think it's two, three, the second grade or third grade. So based on my experience as a child, I was able to lift things that, those things that adults could lift. So I could also, I would be able to distinguish and read different texts and know what ingredients to cook. And I think that's a good experience for me to cook with my parents and enhance the reading.\n- Parents are definitely the primary actor to teach children how to eat responsibly and healthily. And apart from that, friends, especially those older ones, or older relatives should help children understand how to eat healthily.

I'm from Xi'an, a inland city in the North China. And I work here as a software engineer. I really like this city. Firstly, Xi'an is a very beautiful city. And the local people are very friendly and helpful. If you get lost, you can ask them for help. There are many people all over the world that you can meet and make friends with. Xi'an is also a motor city with a long history of more than 7,000 years. And it's a famous for much place of interest, like the build tower. I feel so lucky to be in the city. It's so big and exciting like Xi'an. I like to look out with my apartment windows over the high-reason building. Some people say, ah, it's too noisy and cloudy. But I love that there are many things to see and to do. You know, here is the great most of the demo. In many times, I don't like it really much. It's in the summer. It's too hot, I think. The second reason is my friends are living there. You know, friends for me is very important because I think friends are the people who we like to share experience with. And in the weekend, I often go out with my friends. We watch the movies and eat at the hot pot. You know, it's very comfortable and we like the people to do something interesting with their friends.\n- Yeah, I told this list to my foreigner friend, you know, I guess the mainline is Chinese culture.

Because it is really, really a good place.\n- Well, it depends on the individual person. I mean, it varies from person to person. Taking photos can be a way to memorizing your trips or tours. I mean, it's a kind of reminder. So if you'd like to have those posters, you can just keep it. As for me, I think some of people like me who don't have the habit of taking photos, we will just keep the scenery in my heart and remind it in my mind.\n- I guess some of them are available for me to have comments with or just take their recommendation. Because if people go to someone new, they will have no any experiences, so they will get some help or advice from others. So the advice on the internet can be something helpful.", "- Yes, I'll describe a time I make a promise to my childhood friend.

He promised, he advised me to visit his home and I agree. So we promised each other to visit each home. I think it's not a hard promise, but for me, that time it's hard to come true. Bye.\n- No, actually no, because I think it creates a secret of us, so I don't tell another people.\n- I think it is a promise about eating with each other.

And after a week, my landlord told me that there would be a hiking in the next weekend. And at that time I had no friends in Hangzhou, so I'm lonely and I would like to make some new friends. So I think it was a great opportunity for me to make some friends with maybe the same hobbies or some person in the same situation with me. And I went to hiking and the most difficult part for me is actually to remember many people's names because I'm not good at it. So I just asked my neighbors and landlord to introduce me to others. I think it was a very good activity because I actually made some new friends from hiking. And one of them is still my friends who chat often. So I think maybe some hiking and other outdoor activities is very good for a person who moved into a new city and have new friends in this city. Thank you.", "- Yes, but seeing is always easier than doubt. I mean, the equal opportunity to succeed is doubt. It's very difficult.\n- So, what do you think?

So I often listen to different kinds of music.\n- For me, I think it is most, maybe the Chinese traditional music, because every Chinese people, they like to listen to some songs related to our culture.\n- Actually, I want to see Jack Cho in chat because I think he brought out a lot of songs about Chinese culture and I love his song very much.", "- I don't plan my time on the day.

And I think the animals are so cute, like the panda, like the cat, like some fish, it's very cute. I think GoToTheZoo can relax.\n- Yes, I think so. Because some animals in the wild, they will have many dangerous things. But in the zoo, they just eat, sleep, and play. So I think it's a very nice way to protect the animals.", "- Like, we are just reading those vocabulary books and like they teach that.\n- It's like really tiny but it fits like 40 or 50 students so it's really nice.\n- Thank you.

Although there are definitely alternatives to this, you can still text them or tell them to be a newsing person. It might actually feel more special that way, because not everyone checks social media that much these days.\n- Of course not. The media should report news objectively whether it's good news or bad news. Besides, who has the right to decide which news are good and which news are bad? Some news can be good for certain people, bad for others. So nobody should have the right to define good news or bad news and forbid others from telling from posting bad news. That is just too much power.\n- Well, social media is probably, I don't see most, but it's definitely efficient at getting information around. However, the quality of information on social media is generally pretty low. You have to spend a lot of time filtering low quality information, and that could actually cost more time than you would if you just use a search engine yourself. Besides, now we have artificial intelligence. You can probably simply ask AI questions and they'll answer you in a more efficient manner.", "- I believe that being an entrepreneur would allow me to use my creativity and knowledge to make a difference in society.

I was in high school in Scotland at the time he and he just transferred to our school from England in a town in a town where I live. We didn't often meet many people from other countries, so we weren't familiar with other fashion styles. It was a real surprise when this new student from thousands of miles away arrived, dressed in clothes none of us have ever seen before. Alexander was of our age, of course, but he seemed like he was from another planet. He spoke differently and acted differently and, as I said, he dressed differently. For one thing, we all wore school uniform, but on his first day he didn't. He wore his normal street clothes. But normal for him, it wasn't exactly normal for most people. He had a weird style, but it worked for him. He mixed and matched colors that were bright and bold and he layered one type of clothing over another such as wearing a suit jacket over a vest with a tie but no collar. He was really unusual and everyone thought he was cool because of it. He also wore several different types of hats, even though hats weren't exactly in fashion back then. Still, wearing something that no one else wore just made him stick out even more. Most importantly, I think Alexander appeared confident in what he wore. I guess he just didn't care what others felt or perhaps he had special insights into what clothes would look good on him, even if they seemed unusual in many cases.

Our reading interests were diverse, ranging from fantasy and adventure, novels to books on science, history, and biographies of inspiring individuals. We were insatiable and the library's vast collection never disappointed us. Sometimes we'd get so engrossed in our books that we'd spend entire afternoons reading in the library itself, losing track of time amidst the stacks. I immensely enjoyed this activity for several reasons. First, reading transported me to different worlds, allowed me to experience diverse perspectives, and ignite my imagination. I found this both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Secondly, it was a shared experience with my brother and our discussions about the books we read brought us closer.

During the start of the winter we decided to go to Moraine for shopping and bicycles. We took permission from our hostel warden for an outing on the weekend. We took unnecessary riding gear like gloves, helmets and all bottles. We started our trip early in the morning. There were two villages on the way. After half an hour we stopped near the first village to rest and had a cup of tea. We started riding again after 15 minutes after covering wind kilometers.

We covered a distance of 18 kilometers within an hour and reached our destination. Even though we were all exhausted because we did not cover the longest distance before that. We enjoyed a lot.

Most of the leaves are yellow and red. And we take a really long way to the mountain. And after that we climb the mountain. We have a good picnic there. Then when we come back, it starts raining. It's really heavy rain. So we have to find a place to hide and it was really late in the night and it's also on the mountain. So it's a little bit of danger but because my father made me, so I feel pretty good. But after that, when I got a little bit older, he told me at that time he was really afraid. So because it's in the mountains, so there's a chance that some white guy would rob us. So he's really conscious about that and he even prepared to call the police to pick us up.

To begin with, let's delve into the cognitive and productivity aspects. The human brain, self-sophisticated as it is, wasn't designed for extended periods of intense focus and cognitive processing. Such as the study by Desktime, one of the most productive employees, productivity tracking software companies, suggests that the most productive people working for 52 minutes and then take a break for 17 minutes. The model aligns with the notion of ultra-dien rhythms, natural body cycles occurring multiple times in a 24-hour day. During each cycle, there is a peak when we are most alert and at 12 when we are exhausted. Respecting these rhythms by taking breaks can help maintain optimal cognitive function. Additionally, taking breaks faster, creativity, when you step away from a task, you allow your mind to wander and make connections that might not make when you are deeply focused. This so-called diffusion thinking can lead to innovative solutions and creative insights. On the mental health front, working or studying without breaks can lead to stress, burnout, and feelings of overwhelm. Regular breaks, especially ones involving relaxation or activities that bring joy, can significantly reduce stress levels and foster a sense of well-being. From a physical perspective, prolonged sitting or screen time can contribute to various health issues including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and computer vision syndrome.

Overall, the opportunities for engagement, entertainment, and education available to young people today are arguably more diverse and abundant than they were 20 years ago. Firstly, the digital revolution has significantly expanded the range of activities available for young people. The advent of the internet and subsequent explosion of digital technologies has led to a proliferation of online activities that were simply not possible 20 years ago. Today, youth can engage in an array of online gaming experiences participating in various social media platforms, enrolling e-learning courses, developing skills through online tutorials, collaborating on digital projects, and much more. Furthermore, the ubiquity of smartphones has enabled young people from to access information, communicate, and engage in activities anywhere, anytime anywhere. This has not only made a broader range of activities accessible, but also created new ones. For instance, augmented reality games like Pokemon Go and or the trend of vlogging. Secondly, globalization and advancement in transport or communication technologies have made international travel more accessible, allowing young people to engage in activities like study abroad programs, international volunteer work, and youth exchange programs. In the sphere of education and skill development, there are more opportunities than ever before. From coding camps, maker spaces, entrepreneurship programs, to art workshops, there's a wealth of resources available for young people to explore their interests and talents, and these are continuously expanding. Moreover, societal attitudes towards youth activities have also involved. There's a growing recognition of the importance of youth engagement in civic activities, leading to more opportunities for young people to get involved in community service, activism, and leadership roles. Likewise, the acceptance and encouragement of diverse interests and identities have allowed to a broader range of clubs and organizations that cater to different passions and backgrounds. That said, it's crucial to note that access to these growing opportunities is not equally distributed. Factors such as socioeconomic status, geographical location, and internet access can significantly impact the range of activities accessible to young people. In conclusion, the last 20 years have seen a significant increase in diversification in the activities available to young people. This is largely driven by technological advancements, globalization, and shiftments in societal attitudes. However, efforts should continue to ensure that all young people, regardless of their circumstances, can benefit from the growing range of opportunities for engagement, growth, and development.\n- In countries like the United States, for example, achieving a work-life balance can be quite challenging. Long working hours, minimum application time, and the blurring lines between work and personal life due to the rise of a remote work can impede work-life balance. A report by the OECD showed that the United States ranked 30 out of 38 countries in terms of work-life balance as of 2020. On the other hand, countries like Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands often rank high on the work-life balance indices, thanks to supportive labor laws, a culture that valued leisure and family time, and widespread flex of working practices. However, even in countries with favorable conditions, achieving work-life balance can still be challenging due to factors such as personal work habits, the nature of one's jobs, or societal expectations. For instance, individuals in high stress professions or those who face societal or internal pressure to prioritize work over personal life might struggle with work-life balance regardless of supportive policies or norms. Moreover, work-life balance doesn't solely depend on working hours. It also encompasses the ability to enjoy quality leisure time and maintain mental and physical health over work stress and burnout can occur even in flexible working conditions if individuals don't manage their workloads or stress levels effectively or if their leisure time is not truly restorative. In conclusion, while certain environments, policies, and practices can facilitate work-life balance, whether most people can achieve this balance is nuanced and depends on a merit of factors, achieving work-life balance is a multifaceted issue requiring a combination of supportive policies, workplace culture change, and the individual strategies for managing work and personal life demands. Given the complexity and individual hourly of this issue, it's challenging to make a broad generalization about the ability of most people to achieve work-life balance in any given country.", "- Yes, my uncle and my family members all my family members love the and has the same taste as I am and we also love meat and the steak or beef, the pox and the chickens.\n- well I like every snacks whatever the flavor it is for example I like the cake chocolate cake strawberry cake cream cake I like all the cakes that has sweet and the sugar on it\n- yes both went from my young like five years old to now 26 year old I just love the sweetie things and I also have a sweet tooth", "- Go Shopping!\n-  curry\n- I often go back to my school.", "- I enjoy reading books with feed to computers because it can help me my work.

While the primaries send it interesting, the execution felt short for me.

My parents bought me my first cycle when I was 10 years old and it helped me become more confident in myself.

Most of the time I just read only by myself, but I had a friend there and we often met together to read for the whole day together. We have lunch together too. She was maybe one of the best friends for me and we even sometimes met up together until now. Speaking of why I enjoyed it, I have always been a quiet child. I don't like to be aware that it's too noisy. I really enjoyed studying in a quiet library and reading by myself. I didn't like the fairy tales or some story books and picture books even when I was quite young. I prefer the masterpieces.

Usually we would go to a flat place where the buildings are not really high or probably no buildings around. So we would fly the kite and enjoy.

I'm so into all types of music and I guess that each type of music has its own feature.\n- I mean, for example, you see classical music has a pattern of sounds made by traditional musical instruments. Electronic music, on the other hand, contains human voices or computers or just a combination of these. So each type of music intends to give pleasure to people. So that's why I find them so engaging.\n- Oh, I would say it's definitely pop music. I mean, it's called pop music for a reason, right? As a type of modern popular music, it usually comes with a strong beat and created with the electronic or electronic equipment and it's easy to listen to and remember. So that's why it can be hugely popular in my country.", "- Well, the most important trend would be that it focuses more on automation, AI technology, things that do automatically to help people to do less and gain more. Whereas when I was younger, it basically helped people to transfer from a more paper-based way of life to a more electronic way of life. So I think it's an evolution or technology in that sense. Yeah, I think that is the biggest change.\n- Small businesses like small pop and man shops that people would open, small restaurants. I think those are pretty, you know, the go-to small business that one can think of on top of their minds.\n- I think I would prefer big companies because big companies are more insured, the quality is more controlled and if you have any issues with the product you have easier time to get a refund or replacement for small companies. I do understand that they have higher operation costs so sometimes they would try not to have refunds and replacements and so on. So it's understandable but as a consumer I would prefer big companies with their insurance policies so I think that is my choice.", "- Yes, definitely, I think singing and songs can bring happiness and power to the people.\n- Well, I like rock music because I think I can dance to the rock music and rock music can bring me some power.\n- No, actually I often listen to different kinds of music because I have different emotions in different time.", "- Well, I like to read books related to computers and when I include work, it's difficult.

If you have great three kingdoms theory, you will know the story about Luzh Jingzhou because he is an ignore enemy. Let's talk back to Jingzhou. It's a place where everyone enjoys it. It's stable food, it's rice and noodles. It's very delicious. I am very enjoying it. It has also great sound.", "- Yes, I would say actually not often go to Zooms, but I occasionally go to Zooms. I kind of enjoy it and really depends on like how much the Zoo managers dedicate their time to enrich the experience of the visitors. Some zoos just have sporadic animals spreading around the zoos. So you just take a look and the environment is dirty. So in this case, I don't really like the zoos, but there are other zoos where, you know, it's, there is a plethora of animals and you can really see them enjoying their lives. Sometimes there are some entertainment activities within the zoos which can increase, you know, your experience as a visitor. And also this could be controversial, but if there are some, if there are some performance with that, you know, performance by the animals like tires and they're just doing some difficult tasks with the human trainer. Although some people would argue that's unethical and inhumane to train the animals this way because they must have experienced very hard treatment in order to achieve that level of perform, performant behavior. But I still think that as a visitor from a visitor's perspective, it's a perfect zoo experience.\n- Well, how often I would go to the Zeus maybe every year and that's it because there's no incentive to, if you're not moving to another city, there's no meaning to repeatedly go to the same zoo in a city because it's usually constantly stay the same. And even if you're good to the other cities, which is not too often in my case, the Zeus oftentimes won't be the first choice. And that's also the case if you're good to the big cities, if you go to a smaller cities or the countryside or just want to go to a remote place to see the landscapes, then it's unlikely that you will go to Zeus. So overall, people have the less tendency to go to Zeus, so it's not that often I would say overall on average for the general population.\n- And for the Visiting Zoo Museum is that you can understand, you can gain more knowledge about the animals, a variety of kinds of animals, and you can see that we as humans actually live a much different life than these animals, which in tens of thousands or millions of years ago, which is not too many years over the span of the Earth or over the span of the entire universe, you can see that many, many years ago we probably all lived in the wild and have to experience the life without much organization, without much purpose, but now we live such a different life and you can see a different perspective from how the Mother Earth involves and how randomness actually in fact can make an impact on how different things live in different lives.", "- Of course I have to. Yeah, I did. I mean, when I was younger, I mean, I'm not obliged to do that. To do that, my dad would encourage me to do that. And although, I'd say, like, a long process, I enjoyed it. And I'm not enjoying the process per se, but I enjoy the cleanliness afterwards.\n- Well.\n- Of course I do.", "- Now I don't want to work in social media because they spend too much time working and they always overwork and I want to spend more time in my real life and I don't want to always spend nine hours or even ten hours working a day.\n- I use a lot of technologies for example laptop or iPhone and I use WeChat, TikTok and many other social networks on my phone and I can work TV and play games on my phone too.\n- Yes, I think that technology is quite important in my life because I use it every day and I work by using my laptop and all kinds of social networks to communicate with my colleagues and by this way I can work better.", "- Yes, I was generally able to stay focused in class when I was a child.

I am really good at taking photographs, taking photos of landscapes and good views, but I'm not really good at taking photos of other people.\n- Well, as a way of recording things, I think it's much simpler and easier for you to take photos than writing a journal or something like that.\n- No, not really, because back then a few decades ago I think going to cinema was really expensive and we cannot afford it when I was a kid.", "- Well, you know, I like to go to the library to read out the weekends.

So because it's in the mountains, so there's a chance that some white guy would rob us. So he's really conscious about that and he even prepared to call the police to pick us up.

But anyway, an activity that I used to enjoy when I was young in my first year at university was dancing. I used to attend a dance class that was run by one of the South African teachers on campus. I think she was from Brazil. I can't recall exactly. Anyway, I loved going to this dance class. It took place two evenings a week and was a great way to stay healthy and fit, enjoy great music, and dance to know other people. Because a lot of these kinds of dances are interactive. Men and women dance together as partners and change partners too. Then it's a really good way to break the ice with people of the opposite sex and become friends or maybe more. We would often go out for drinks after the dance evenings and sometimes they out late chatting or even clubbing in the city. So, yeah, these evenings I particularly enjoyed and for a while the dance society at university was one of the most important things in my life. Apart from studying and all that, it was my social outlet as well as my form of regular exercise and a nice chance to get involved in something more international. It's a shame that I don't seem to get time to do something like that now really, or at least I don't create time and opportunity. Maybe I should make the effort just thinking about it makes me feel a bit\n- Yeah, I told my parents and my old friends, for my parents they were very worried about my university life because I chose a university that was not in my hometown and I didn't leave them for 18 years. So they were very worried about me and my social life. So I told them that I joined the dance club and make some new friends.\n- Yeah, I think it's very important to have a break during work or study because people often focus on what they do no more than one hour. So after one hour high tension of work or study, people have to have a break and release", "- If I had a day off tomorrow, I would love to spend time outdoors and enjoy the nice weather. Maybe go for a hike or a bike ride, or just relax in a park and have picnics. I also enjoy read, so I might grab a book and spend some time at a coffee cozy coffee shops. Whatever I end up doing, I just want to make sure to recharge and take advantage of the free times.\n- Yes, I'm familiar with several small businesses in my local areas. They include independent coffee shop, bakery, and boutique clothing store. I appreciate the unique characters that small business brings to the community.\n- Personally, I prefer to buy things from small business whenever possible. I find that they often offer unique and high quality products with a more personal touch. However, I do recognize the convenience of big companies for certain purchase.", "- No, actually not. I don't like to take a photo. Even with my girlfriend, I don't like to take a photo too.\n- Actually, I take it with my cell phone. I think cell phone is easy to use and can be taken quickly.

So I just felt really excited. I was over the moon. So that means I would play the cards with my family members and my classmates. So that was really fun experience. It was really nice.\n- I wish I could go on a picnic but honestly speaking I don't have any time because I'm working now and there's much assignment I need to do to handle. Maybe if I'm free I will pick time with my friends and to have a picnic together.

Because during that period, I am always in a rush every day. And I have a really hectic schedule. So sometimes I would mess up. Like I don't really know what to do first and what to do for the next. So that's a problem for me during this period.\n- Yeah, I guess so because sometimes a busy schedule can help me to improve my productivity and my efficiency. It would actually motivate me to work harder to accomplish my goal. But this doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes when I'm super busy with the things I have to do with, I would feel panic and I have no idea what to do next.\n- Actually, we don't have a favorite place I guess. Because every time we go out, we would have actually different plans. Sometimes we would hang out to some new shopping malls and we would have dinner in the newly opened restaurants.

So the thing for the picnic is that there's a lot of people there and it's a chance for you to social with others. In fact, cooking at home is more private so you can cook whatever you want and you can enjoy it at whatever time you want.\n- So, when I was young, about 10 or 11 years old, my father liked to go trip a lot. So he took me to the mountains and I stayed at the back of the bathhouse and she drove me to the mountains. And it's in the autumn. So there's a lot of beautiful signs out there. Most of the leaves are yellow and red. And we take a really long way to the mountain. And after that we climb the mountain. We have a good picnic there. Then when we come back, it starts raining. It's really heavy rain. So we have to find a place to hide and it was really late in the night and it's also on the mountain. So it's a little bit of danger but because my father made me, so I feel pretty good. But after that, when I got a little bit older, he told me at that time he was really afraid. So because it's in the mountains, so there's a chance that some white guy would rob us. So he's really conscious about that and he even prepared to call the police to pick us up. But I have a really great time at that time. I don't know anything. I just enjoyed the great sign and the happy hour with my family, with my father.\n- My mom knows that but others not. Yeah, it's more about private things in the happy time between my father and I because you know the father is more introversion so they don't express their emotions very frequently so that's the time I can feel the love from my father.", "- Well, sometimes, of course, if you desperately want something to come to your life, and it would probably show us in your dream, and also we have a saying that is what happens in dream is the opposite of the reality, and that is kind of amusing because it always happens after nightmares or bad dreams, and it never happens after this conversation never happens after a good or a sweet dream.\n- In a routine basis, I don't usually take photos, but if I am going on a trip or I see something that is really worthy of recording, I would take pictures.\n- Of course I take pictures with my phone because the camera on my cell phone is good enough to take good pictures and I can't afford to buy cameras and especially the cameras are quite expensive nowadays.", "- Yeah, most of the time I do.\n- Um, I used to look at them a lot.\n- Usually go five days a week.", "- Yes, maybe I think there are quite a lot of people who can share their performance. Because the ice cream, if you get online and search the red book or the BDBD, you will see many other people tell their reason about why they like ice cream.\n- The next I like to eat maybe a french fries because the french fries give you the feeling of enjoyment but also it can be as a main course because if you don't have rice or do not want to eat hamburgers it's quite a lot. French fries will also give you the sense of satisfied.\n- Not really. When I was young, I just...although I wanted to eat snacks, but my parents often tried their way to stop me from that because they think it's unhealthy for children to have too much snacks every day. So maybe I have a shorter chance to have it.", "- Yes, I think there are some places where there will be multiple form meetings with others. If the people I need to meet are my friends, I would like to stay at home or some relaxing place. But if it's a formal meeting, I would like to meet them in some formal places like coffee, coffee team and some cam teams.\n- My favorite meeting place now is the library or some cantings. But when I was in my childhood, I was with my friends in the place around the homes, like the fields, like the... So it's not the same place. I think it's the biggest child difference.\n- I think it's designed as a surroundings of the meeting place. For example, the library is more quiet. It is suitable for meeting others and talking to them.", "- Yes, because I live near by farm.\n- I like four vegetables and some plants. I think they can make me feel happy and make me feel enjoyable.\n- Of course, farming is a potential part of our country because we need to eat some rice from farming. So we can't be part of farming.", "- No, I don't ride a bike when I go out now. Nowadays, I prefer to walk or use public transport, as it's more convenient for me. However, I do miss the fun and freedom of riding my bike, and I hope to start doing it again soon.\n- Yes, I usually carry a bag with me when I go out. I find it helpful to have a place to store my belongings, like my phone, wallet, and keys. It also makes it easier to carry any additional items I might need, like an umbrella or water bottle. I have different bags for different occasions, like a backpack for work or a small purse for going out with friends. Overall, I find it convenient to have a bag with me in my daily life.\n- Now, I don't change my bags very often. I tend to stick with one bag for a while until it starts to wear out, or until I find a new one that I really like. I think it's important to invest in a good quality bag that can last for a long time rather than constantly buying new ones.", "- No, actually I often listen to different kinds of music because I have different emotions in different time.\n- Yes, I think everyone has different feelings or different emotions in different time and situations in their lives.

He invited me to play together. And we played all day in the daytime. And when we went back home, he invited me to visit his house. So we promised each other. One day, we'll invite each other to visit his home. So maybe you think it's a simple promise. But for me, in the daytime, I need to be more and more brave to promise him.

While I do appreciate these genres, my personal preference for music tends to be a bit different. I enjoy listening to rock music and alternative styles, which I find to be more complex and interesting. However, we still enjoy music together and share our favorite artists and songs with each other.\n- The most popular genre of music where I live is pop music. It is played on almost every radio station and most people seem to enjoy listening to it. Pop music has a catchy beat and lyrics that are easy to remember and it appeals to a wide audience. I also know there is a lot of rap and hip-hop music in my area which is often played in clubs and at social events.\n- If I had the chance, I would love to see Ed Sheeran perform live.

It is because in some genres of art are quite boring for me as far as I can see.\n- Yes, I pretty much like the art galleries because I like the atmosphere of that. It's quiet and so peaceful. I think most art galleries are quite inspiring for me to visit and I can learn so many things about culture and history.\n- Well, I think it's quite romantic for someone to dream to be an artist, but for me I am not planning to be an artist. First of all, it is quite hard to be a qualified artist and for me I am not talented to do that job. The second reason is that for the career issues it is also more difficult for an artist to earn a lot of money, that is to say.", "- Well, maybe I will just leave my cell phone far away from me or just mute my cell phone in order to not be distracted from or by some message when I was studying.\n- Well, as I said before, I have to mute my cell phone for the reason that when some message comes to my cell phone, I can't control myself to check it and to send some message to my friends or my colleagues. That is the main element to distract my concentration.\n- Actually, I'm not a fan of classical books. I prefer interesting books, for example, fairy tales.

So based on my experience as a child, I was able to lift things that, those things that adults could lift. So I could also, I would be able to distinguish and read different texts and know what ingredients to cook. And I think that's a good experience for me to cook with my parents and enhance the reading.\n- Parents are definitely the primary actor to teach children how to eat responsibly and healthily. And apart from that, friends, especially those older ones, or older relatives should help children understand how to eat healthily. And throughout the children's education experiences, I believe all the preschool teachers, elementary school teachers, middle school, high school teachers, even college professors should really influence children to eat healthily.\n- I believe they do because nowadays there are more information to access on the internet and as parents they can have better access to the information online about what is, what should be eaten and children themselves by watching on the YouTube, TikTok and other social media platforms they probably can eat more healthily but as a caveat I've heard that there are some competition to binge eat, to eat unhealthily so there's a potential that children cannot do good on that.", "- I'm probably my grandparents because it might come off the Odors like way What did I say that would?

I always recommend this place to my classmates and even my family. I always told them it's a really best and right place to practice your homework. And you know, it's the best is not the library itself, but also you can go straddle with the library. And then arrive at the park. It's another place to practice your spoken English and nobody will kill you. And you can say something you want.\n- Oh, definitely, you know, this public place plays a key role in changing intons of cities, such as the library or museums. They also pay the really important role in reaching people's interest and providing many opportunities for them to relax and learn. And secondly, if they want to learn more, they can find some resources in that and which can provide more chance to share with their competitive engine and make them separated from the public.\n- Oh, in fact, as I mentioned before, this library is a public place for the old papers. Many old papers always win their true reading newspaper or just talk about it themselves. And you know there is a computer room so that they can go surfing the internet and browsing their websites. And on the other hand, in many other countries, I think Mabye Park is another important place for all the people. People can go there to do more exercise or to play the chess and just talk a walk.", "- The famous person that I'm interested in is Jack Ma, a Chinese entrepreneur and philanthropist. He's the founder of Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. I first learned about Jack Ma when I was studying business in college. He was often mentioned as a prominent figure in the Chinese tech industry. I became curious about his story and how he had achieved such remarkable success. Before he became famous, Jack Ma struggled with setbacks and rejections. He was rejected from many jobs and was even turned down by KFC when they opened up their first restaurant in China. Eventually, he founded Alibaba Group in 1999, I believe, which started out as an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers. What interests me most about Jack Ma is his perseverance and his commitment to social responsibility. He has faced many obstacles in his career but has always maintained a positive attitude and willingness to learn from his mistakes. Additionally, he has used his wealth and influence to give back to society, supporting courses such as environmental protection and education. In conclusion, I think Jack Ma is an inspiring figure who has made a significant impact on the Chinese tech industry and beyond. His story shows that with hard work, perseverance and willingness to take risks, anyone can achieve great things. I'm interested in him for his vision, his business acumen and his passion, commitment to making the world a better place.\n- Well, he's well known, so I don't have to tell other people about him.\n- Well, there are many different kinds of famous people. There are celebrities, well, the traditional type of celebrities like actors, actresses, and the big names in a lot of professional fields, like scientists, and also there are this new type of celebrity, the online influencers, which is a big group, so in the modern society.", "- Oh yeah, definitely. I'm really looking forward to. I know there is a city called Suzhou in the south of China and it's famous for its older buildings and architectures. So I always want to see it and take some photos about it.\n- In fact, I'm not a coffee maniac, so in fact, I haven't noticed some coffee shops. When I take a work with my classmates during the rest and we just hang out, by accident we found a really beautiful and unique coffee shop and then we went into it. At first, I feel a little interested in about it, but I want to try something to test some delicious snacks. Then I order some snacks and coffee. What's surprising is that the snacks and coffee in this coffee shop were really delicious and yummy. You can say that it impressed me a lot and changed my mind about coffee shops. From then on, we always went to there and tested some special coffee shop. In fact, I can't remember how time we went to there about three times a week. It is in a good location, which is just located in the mountain of the moment and near our school. So it is really convenient and flexible for us to go to there to have some coffee or just have a rest.\n- Oh yeah, definitely, yes.", "- So, who would you vote for in the next presidential election? Biden or Trump?\n- Wait, who is this veteran who is running for office? Because neither Biden nor Trump is a veteran.\n- Did you know that Biden's song was a veteran? Do you think that he would be more friendly to veterans because of that?", "- How do public places change in towns and cities? Well, it really mostly depends on the collective well of the community. And if they think that those facilities should exist, then those facilities are helping them live a better life, then they would have the tendency to keep that place. And on the other hand, you know, if they don't like this place, we will probably have the proposal to change the facilities. And for example, if it's a playground and there are no longer a lot of child kids playing around there, or young people playing around there, then the older people who are dominating the community will propose to build some public place, public facilities that's more user-friendly to the older people. And yeah, that's basically it.\n- Huh, that's an interesting question. What public place do older people usually visit? I actually don't know too much about where old people visit. Well, I think religious places are one of the most common places, destinations for old people. Because, you know, I mean, here in the US, people go to church a lot. And in China, some old people I see will go to the temples. And if they are Christians, they also go to church a lot. Because for old people, they don't work anymore. They want to find some spiritual experience that they can find meaning in life. And church or religious places would be a very good place for them to go.\n- Why do young people like to go to public places? Well, it's a great place for them to aggregate and socialize. And humans are mostly like to aggregate with each other and communicate with each other. Especially for young people, they want to socialize with their peers. And they may play sports there, which can only make them enjoy the sport themselves more. Because they're playing a team, playing against others. They can also increase the bond between these people. And yeah, young people mostly would not stay at home all day long. They want to go out and play and socialize.", "- Yeah, I used to eat snacks with my classmates sometimes even in a during class.\n- Sorry, I don't understand.

And, you know, this is something that's, if something is very picturistic, you can take great pictures there and share with your friends and post it online. And in the future you can post it about it and it really makes you feel very good. And the meaning, the purpose of traveling is all about, you know, the experience and the reward you can get. And I believe that by doing the things that I mentioned above, like sharing with friends, boasting about it, add great meaning to the travel itself. And of course I would think it's worthwhile, worth the time and worth the cost.\n- Well, because mainly because we are free human beings capable of traveling, but in more detail, people travel because of many reasons. For one, they want to see something different out of their mundane and routine life. They want to try something new. They want to see a world with different landscape, with different people, with different languages. So that really enriches their life experience according to you know, Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It's really going up the hierarchy of needs and that really satisfies people and that's what people want.\n- Well, they have the capital, they have the resources in the first place to make a fame to attract the tourists in the first place. And why do places with historical sites develop tourism industry more actively, of course, is because they know that they have the reputation to attract users, attract the tourists. And of course, given the natural endowments, why don't they do that? People have the resources, people have the endowments, they will do that.", "- I think the most makes me enjoy is my math teacher. Yes, math is a very hard subject for me, but I think my teacher is a good person and a good teacher. He can tell me everything and teach me how to control the math.

Also I need to, although I want to see them, but the time is the biggest problem.\n- I always do housework with my family and cooking is so hard for me so I never do it.

Basically you have to get into this mindset where you just tell yourself that nothing is going to distract me from doing what I'm doing right now. So I think it's one of the mind things, it's more the control, psychological control you have rather than physical technique.\n- Well, it's not very difficult for me because I want to do things that interest me. So if I'm interested in it, basically I just look, let's get lost and toss myself. So it's not hard for me, per se, but I think it's hard for a lot of people now and then with the apps again, more interesting with the algorithm than with them just trying to to trick you into watching videos that are similar to your likes. So I think it's hard for a lot of people, but personally I think it's not that hard for me.\n- I prefer to read books that has more of a historical context. It could be a history book that tells you the specifics of a certain time. It also could be historical novel where the plot is set up under a realistic historical theme.

From our childhood to now, we have known each other for nearly 10 years, and our friendship is always very good. She is a delicate person and very optimistic. She always noticed that I was in a bad mood as a first time, or tried all kinds of ways to make me happy. For example, when I was frustrated because of my unsatisfactory grace, she always gave me chocolate, and encouraged me that an Okonomic steak doesn't have to be taken so seriously. Besides, she is good at learning, and she often tells me a lot of practical learning approaches. She is really beneficial to help me pick up high scores and achieve high academic performance.

Because my work is always used with the computers. So I have to sit on the table, on the desk, and watching the computer screens for most of my working time.\n- Hmm, actually it depends. If I'm concentrating on the things that I'm interested in, I won't feel bored. But if the things just go so embarrassed or so boring, I will distract by something else. And another situation is that I may fall asleep.\n- Well, I actually do not have a memory of that. Because I think sitting on the floors may be the things that the boys do. And however, you know, I'm a girl who likes a tiny and quiet place to sit.", "- Yes, I can't agree more.\n- Yes, I think so.\n- Thank you Yorah Kam.

So it was a fun way to get some exercise without feeling like I was working out in the gym. So I also enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment that came with making a difficult shot or winning a match. So in short, playing basketball with my friends was one of my favorite activities in my free time when I was in primary school. And it gave me a sense of accomplishment and joy.

Only me.\n- I never think about it, but maybe I will cook it.", "- Parents are definitely the primary actor to teach children how to eat responsibly and healthily. And apart from that, friends, especially those older ones, or older relatives should help children understand how to eat healthily. And throughout the children's education experiences, I believe all the preschool teachers, elementary school teachers, middle school, high school teachers, even college professors should really influence children to eat healthily.\n- I believe they do because nowadays there are more information to access on the internet and as parents they can have better access to the information online about what is, what should be eaten and children themselves by watching on the YouTube, TikTok and other social media platforms they probably can eat more healthily but as a caveat I've heard that there are some competition to binge eat, to eat unhealthily so there's a potential that children cannot do good on that.\n- Well, in Chinese culture, food is so important. Different regions have their own various food, and there's a plethora of food for the country as a whole. And even for the entire world, like for the country, the United States, where I'm living right now, the Chinese food is one of the most popular food types, and it's really very influential. So I would say the Chinese people have created a deep culture about eating and about food. So the answer to your question is yes, of course.", "- Well, I think the most important way to stay happy is to let yourself be satisfied to present. As the other saying goes, present is a present for you. It should be a gift.

It is very popular, especially among older people, because it is a good way to exercise.

When I was young, I just...although I wanted to eat snacks, but my parents often tried their way to stop me from that because they think it's unhealthy for children to have too much snacks every day. So maybe I have a shorter chance to have it.\n- Not at all, because we know there are quite a lot of sugar in the snacks and other things like oil which can provide you too much fat that you don't eat for every day. And what's more, the snacks often give you the sense of hangry and you are keeping on eating that for hours and hours. It's really unhealthy for that, I think.\n- Not at all because if we come to the sweet chocolate, I think it's too sweet for my taste. I have a taste that cannot endure it.

My parents taught me some basic skills to fix things around the house, like changing a light bulb or fixing a loose screw. However, I mostly learned through trial and error as I grew up and faced different repair challenges.\n- Like plastic bags, plastic bottles, and I think it's important for people to have basic repair skills so they can take care of more issues around the house without replying to professionals.

If someone feels they're treated honestly and they're respected and the workplace is transparent and they know what they should know, then I think they're very motivated and they will make more and more contributions to the farm.\n- Well, I think from the get-go, from the beginning, you have to align with the entire team about these values so that, you know, if they have any objections, any doubts, they can clarify and they can give some suggestions. And once that's said, everyone is on the same page. We should set the expectation that everyone should follow these values. And of course, the leadership itself has to follow these. They can't hide a lot of secrets from employees. They have to treat them honestly and with high respect. And that way, it will trickle down from higher up to bottom. And that's very important.\n- Yes, I think having a manual outline these values and keep them on the desk are very important. But I sometimes doubt a little bit whether you should put them on a desk. I mean, if you communicate well and remind people sometimes and act out these values on your own, people will get it and they won't forget it and they will try to practice it on databases as well.", "- The local people in this place is very friendly and helpful. I'm the local people too. I think we all like to eat noodles in there. And we often climb the mountains there. So I think the local people are very nice. I told my friends about this place.

When I'm child, the public place like the park is very like this in my city. Maybe just 10 parks? Maybe. But now, near my home, it's just two parks. I think it's a very big change in this public place. For example, except the park and the library is too.\n- The square or the park, you know, in China, many old men and many old women usually dance the square dance in the square or the park.

Maybe we can have a chat for this book. But if my friend don't like this book or it's not interesting in this book, now I can't share my feelings.

For most of the time, they prepared breakfast at home, at least in China, we did something like that. And they prepared lunch or otherwise they would chose what their children would eat. So for lunch and they cook dinner for their children after work. So I think parents should do that.\n- I don't think so because with or without parents, children will figure out ways to buy things like snacks and well like things like fried chicken, fast food. So because I think most children, most kids, they just like this kind of junk food and no matter if their parents told them not to eat those kind of things, they will figure out a way to buy them for themselves. So I don't think they will eat healthy, they will eat healthily in the future.\n- Well, yes, I do think so because in different places in China, we have different kind of food. People choose to eat. We have different way of cooking, different way of processing the food and the ingredients and everything. So I do think they play a very important part in my country.", "- Yes, I...\n- Yes, I would like to write some short essays after I watch a film.\n- right axis on movies as well as", "- I like all kinds of cars.\n- driver\n- I wait and like yeah because I have an autopilot so I just open autopilot sometimes I listen to music and or listen to some some podcast that's interesting", "- Hmm, jest to in\u017c, but not.\n- Yes, of course. I'll describe a person who impressed me most when we were in primary school. And the person is a boy and he named Hao Zhe. And we meet together in my primary school and we are classmates. I remember one day we were late on my lessons together because we played each other on playgrounds. But the time is not enough so we were late on my lessons. So after this we made good friends with each other. And he was a famous person in my class because he was an opportunity and he was smart.

Whenever I take on a task or a project, I try to give it my full attention and stay engaged until it is completely successful.\n- I'll just stay focused. I begin by setting clear goals and breaking them down into smaller achievable tasks. I animate distractions by turning off my phone or finding a quiet workspace.\n- Staying focused in a noisy environment can be challenging.

I try to avoid doing anything too stimulating that might keep me up even later, like playing video games or engaging in intense exercise. Instead, I like to do things that help me wind down and relax so that I can eventually get to sleep.\n- If I stay up late the night before, I often feel groggy and sluggish the next morning. It can be difficult to concentrate on tasks, and I usually need an extra cup of coffee or two to get through the day. Overall, it's not a pleasant feeling, and I try to avoid staying up too late on a regular basis. I'm not a very good person, but I'm not a very good person. I'm just a very good person.

I'm just a very good person.\n- One of the most meaningful gifts I have ever received was a hand-made quilt from my grandma. The quilt is made of different patches of fabric, each with a unique pattern and color. My grandma spent months working on it, stitching each piece of fabric together with care and attention to detail. I received the quilt as a gift on my 18th birthday. My grandma surprised me with it during a family gathering and I was overwhelmed with gratitude and emotion. I had always admired my grandma's quilting skills and having a piece of her handiwork meant a lot to me. After I received the quilt, I displayed it proudly in my bedroom for several months. Whenever I looked at it, I was reminded of my grandma's generosity and her love for me. The quilts also became a symbol of my family's history and traditions, as many of the patches were made from old clothes and fabrics that have been passed down from generation to generation. Over the years, I have continued to cherish the quilts. Whenever I feel homesick or miss my family, I wrap myself up in it and feel the sense of comfort and connection that it brings. Overall, this gift holds a special place in my heart because it represents my family's love, perseverance and creativity. It is a reminder of the bonds that tie us together and the importance of taking time to create things that are meaningful and lasting.", "- Well, I would say the benefits include, you know, knowing, feeling the pleasure of knowing different kinds of animals and plants. Also, experiencing the pleasure of having a trip with your friends and families. And that's a very important aspect of life.\n- Yeah, I would describe a city where I really enjoy is the Atennis Court. 15 minutes drive from my home where there are plenty of courts available and some courts are near the Hudson River and it's an excellent place for me and my friends to play tennis. Even after sunset, you can still rely on the lamps on the streets to do some serving of tennis and it's a great place for me to exercise and I have a strong body because of that.\n- Not much people because I want to keep a place more to my close friend because I don't want too many people being there and occupying my courts.", "- There is no reason.\n- In your view, who should be responsible to teach children to eat healthy?\n- Do you think children will eat more healthy in the future?", "- No, not really, because back then a few decades ago I think going to cinema was really expensive and we cannot afford it when I was a kid.\n- I prefer go to cinema with my friends because I don't have quite the same taste for movie or films with my parents so our friends is much better.\n- I prefer watching movies at home because I believe film watching is quite intimate stuff. You're going to be quite emotional when you are actually watching films and I don't think it's a good idea to show your emotional instability to other people.", "- I'm afraid I don't have a good answer for that. I guess one possible option is to incorporate picking opera into popular culture such as TV shows or games.\n- Yeah, that's a good point. But art constantly evolves.\n- I'm not sure how effective that would be. I mean, you can try to teach that and promote that in school, but kids might not like it or be interested in it, so they won't actually learn anything.", "- Yeah, I guess so because sometimes a busy schedule can help me to improve my productivity and my efficiency. It would actually motivate me to work harder to accomplish my goal. But this doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes when I'm super busy with the things I have to do with, I would feel panic and I have no idea what to do next.\n- Actually, we don't have a favorite place I guess. Because every time we go out, we would have actually different plans. Sometimes we would hang out to some new shopping malls and we would have dinner in the newly opened restaurants. Sometimes we would probably just stay at home and watch a movie together. So there is no favorite place I guess.\n- Yeah, cause some places are meant to be an ideal place for people to hang out and chat with each other. Places like cafe and maybe a tea shop or maybe a small bakery where people can sit and have a lovely conversation.", "- Well, my favorite food is... Let me think... maybe pizza.\n- I think pizza is the best food that I can share with my family, my friends, because it's big enough.\n- Well, I don't think so. Only me.", "- Yes, I told my parents this activity and made it late after the high-key, so I high-key was over because they were worried about me because I'm a young girl who was in a very new string, new city, myself.\n- Actually it depends on different kinds of people. For example, for the middle-aged male, fishing is the most popular activity for them. Every weekend when I go to Subway, I can see manning a middle-aged man. They carry a lot of instruments and catch the Subway and trains to go to some fishing park. Well, on the other hand, for the young students, the most popular outdoor activity is hiking because it's good for people's health and they can maybe enjoy the beautiful scene.\n- Not just as I mentioned before, I can say a lot of middle-aged men who carry lots of fishing instruments with them and to catch the subway and train to go to the fishing park.

So I can listen to pop music and relax and learn something from those songs.", "- I don't want to work in social media. I have other things that I'd like to work on. And social media, like I said, it's too fast paced. And there is so much activity and vanity in social media. And I don't want to be a part of it. And I don't want to amplify it. So, no, I don't want to work in social media.\n- Well, the usual suspects, I guess, cell phones and laptops are on top of my list because I use them for pretty much everything from communicating with others to work, to surfing the internet and searching for information and making plans. Well, literally everything that I do probably involves either my cell phone or my laptop.\n- Yes, obviously. I would say technology is important in pretty much everyone's life these days. Everything you do, everything you buy, everything you use probably has a problem with technology behind it, whether you realize it or not. So yes, technology is a very important part of my life.", "- When traveling, I usually use a backpack or a small suitcase with wheels. A backpack is great for exploring a new city or going on a hike, as it's easy to carry and allows me to keep my hands free. A small suitcase with wheels is ideal for longer trips, as it's more spacious and easier to transport between airports and train stations. Overall, the type of bag I use depends on the length and nature of the trip.\n- I think a bag can be a great gift, especially if you know the person's personal style, or if it's a functional bag that they can use for everyday activities. However, some people may be particular about their bags and prefer to choose their own, so it's important to take their preferences into consideration. Ultimately, it depends on the individual and their needs.\n- There's a new shop that recently opened in my city that I'm really excited about. It's called the greenhouse, and it's located in the downtown area. The greenhouse is an eco-friendly lifestyle boutique that sells a curated selection of sustainable and environmentally conscious products. They carry everything from reusable bags and water bottles to organic skin care and clothing made from recycled materials.

To begin with, let's delve into the cognitive and productivity aspects. The human brain, self-sophisticated as it is, wasn't designed for extended periods of intense focus and cognitive processing. Such as the study by Desktime, one of the most productive employees, productivity tracking software companies, suggests that the most productive people working for 52 minutes and then take a break for 17 minutes. The model aligns with the notion of ultra-dien rhythms, natural body cycles occurring multiple times in a 24-hour day. During each cycle, there is a peak when we are most alert and at 12 when we are exhausted. Respecting these rhythms by taking breaks can help maintain optimal cognitive function. Additionally, taking breaks faster, creativity, when you step away from a task, you allow your mind to wander and make connections that might not make when you are deeply focused. This so-called diffusion thinking can lead to innovative solutions and creative insights. On the mental health front, working or studying without breaks can lead to stress, burnout, and feelings of overwhelm. Regular breaks, especially ones involving relaxation or activities that bring joy, can significantly reduce stress levels and foster a sense of well-being. From a physical perspective, prolonged sitting or screen time can contribute to various health issues including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and computer vision syndrome. Taking breaks to move around combats the sedentary lifestyle risks and promotes better physical health. Finally, breaks also play a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. During breaks, the brain has time to consolidate new knowledge and skills which is a vital part of the learning process. To maximize benefits of breaks, it is best to combine different types of activities such as physical movement, relaxation techniques, and even short periods of mindfulness or meditation. Some people find the promoteral technique helpful which involves focused work of a period of 25 minutes into spurred with 5 minutes breaks. In conclusion, far from being a sign of idle news or wasted time, breaks are an essential component of effective work or study habits. They help maintain and even boost productivity, creativity, and overall well-being. Therefore, incorporating regular structured breaks into the work or study routine is highly advisable.\n- The landscape of activities available for young people has undeniably undergone substantial transformation over the past two decades, with the advancement in technology, globalization, and societal attitude playing significant roles in this evolution.

This is largely driven by technological advancements, globalization, and shiftments in societal attitudes. However, efforts should continue to ensure that all young people, regardless of their circumstances, can benefit from the growing range of opportunities for engagement, growth, and development.", "- I would like to tell you about my hometown, Xi'an. I'm from Xi'an, an inline city in North China. There are many people all over the world that you can meet and make friends with. As local people are friendly and helpful, if you get lost, you can ask them for help. Xi'an is also a model city with a history of more than 7000 years. It's the first and foremost interesting place. Like the Beel Tower. I am the software engineer in Xi'an. When I graduated from university, I lived in Xi'an for more than 20 years. The question is why you enjoy spending time there. My friends are out there. I often play with my friends. Xi'an is a big city. There are more drop opportunities in Xi'an. That means you will have more chance and possibility. If you want to make more foreign friends and know more foreign culture, you can live in Xi'an. If I choose my hometown, it's a small city named Shangluo. It also has advantages such as living slow and life is slow. It means you will have more free time to do something you really like. But I don't like this city. I just like Xi'an.\n- The local people in this place is very friendly and helpful. I'm the local people too. I think we all like to eat noodles in there. And we often climb the mountains there. So I think the local people are very nice. I told my friends about this place. My foreigner friends from Korea, Japan and some from the UK. It's very organized for me.\n- I think the change is the number. When I'm child, the public place like the park is very like this in my city. Maybe just 10 parks? Maybe. But now, near my home, it's just two parks. I think it's a very big change in this public place. For example, except the park and the library is too.", "- Well, I think I like travelling by cars, by vehicles because I can see the wonderful views outside the window of the car. Actually, the cars are very effective and fast way of transportation. It's really convenient.\n- Well, I like... Personally, I don't have a car, but I prefer the car with the more seats, the better, because the more seats we have, the more friends we can get along with in the cars. Sometimes we can just have a party in the car, maybe. I think I like this kind of car just for fun.\n- Well, I prefer to be a driver more than a passenger because I think being a driver means I can have the car wherever I want to. I can also have the ownership of the car but compared to passengers I don't have the ownership of the cars. I need to listen to the driver about where to go.", "- Hey, nice to meet you. I prefer a workplace where people are equal and they can have flexible work hours.\n- Yeah, I think honesty, respect and transparency are extremely important. If someone feels they're treated honestly and they're respected and the workplace is transparent and they know what they should know, then I think they're very motivated and they will make more and more contributions to the farm.\n- Well, I think from the get-go, from the beginning, you have to align with the entire team about these values so that, you know, if they have any objections, any doubts, they can clarify and they can give some suggestions. And once that's said, everyone is on the same page. We should set the expectation that everyone should follow these values. And of course, the leadership itself has to follow these. They can't hide a lot of secrets from employees. They have to treat them honestly and with high respect. And that way, it will trickle down from higher up to bottom. And that's very important.", "- I'm freezing.\n- I mean, that's the wrong...\n- Yeah, you can start.", "- I don't understand what's the meaning, please explain for me.

When I have a leisure time and I just have fun and talk with friends and everything, so charming.\n- I mean the place has a lot of tennis court, has a lot of beautiful people, has all kinds of languages, all the most advanced technologies and people share their wealth, share their food and everything is perfect and no disease, that's really beautiful.", "- well definitely the wet and I always enjoy the moist weather rather than a dry one because I have the night tattice so I must dress some weather with the wet wet air\n- I would just stay at home when it rains or snows heavily outside, read some of my books, or just watch my favorite videos.\n- Definitely yes, because they will be free for using and it's a good way to kill time and kick back in those parks or gardens which are located in the public.", "- I would say the cafe or the milk tea stores will be my favorite place to meet friends because you can just slow down your pace and have a dream there, where you can also chat and then talk about the echo dots happened recently.\n- It depends on the conditions. If it's for the formal situations, I would say those classic hotels will be a better choice. Well, as for meeting friends, I would say everywhere. Yes, friends won't mind that.\n- In the past, I used to visit friends in the public places because you won't pay for that. You know, the children do not have enough money always. But now, I'd like to pay for a cup of tea or coffee at the cafe so that you can have a relatively quiet environment to chat.", "- No, I'm not usually too. I remember my first time to go zoo in my childhood, maybe six years old.\n- Maybe once a year, oh, it's not usually. It's not often to watch some about zoo.\n- I think visiting rules will help charging to expand the views and make me know more and more about animals and how to protect animals or how to feed some animals.", "- I like to meet with my friends and a friend.\n- Yeah, I think meeting in a quiet place and you can talk is important.\n- I don't have much differences. I think they are mostly the same.", "- Yes, I have learned singing in my primary school, junior high school and senior high school. And we got music class once a week and our teacher would teach us how to sing but I hadn't taken any professional classes to learn singing.\n- When I was young I often sang for my parents but now I sing for my friends more and I think I would sing for anyone who wants to listen to my music\n- Yes, I do think sing can bring happiness to people because when I was young I sent for my parents' birthday, well very happy at that time and when I am unhappy or I'm upset nowadays I will listen to some music and music can bring me some power and I can get some strength from all the music and the lyrics so I do think music can bring happy to people.", "- Oh yeah, but I can say that I was looking forward to driving car when I was a teenager. But when I got older, I found it was so difficult and dangerous for me to drive a car in the hustle and bustle city. But now when I graduated from high school, I went to learn how to drive. And now I get the license.\n- Oh well, you know, when you are in the traffic jam, it's really terrible and the horror sinks. And so at that time, I always just, just wanted to think about something and far away from the real life. Yeah. Sometimes I would think about, well, I was in the outer space or in the another planet. Yeah. So sometimes I do something is really different from now. Yeah.\n- Oh yeah, definitely. It is really normal and fascinating for me to see some older and historical buildings in my city. And yeah, there is a part about in the south of my city. It's located many older buildings and even there are many people are living there now.", "- I would say I like modern art more with the involvement of more technologies. I've seen some art in New York City. It's very futuristic. It involves a lot of motion and sometimes I just don't understand how it works, how it can be so beautiful. So I personally would prefer modern art because I'm like a future-oriented person.\n- Yeah, the activity I read the most during my free time when I was young was reading. I was fortunate to have a small library near my house which became my sanctuary. My brother and I would go there at least once a week carrying home arm loads of books that we'd devour over the coming days. Our reading interests were diverse, ranging from fantasy and adventure, novels to books on science, history, and biographies of inspiring individuals. We were insatiable and the library's vast collection never disappointed us. Sometimes we'd get so engrossed in our books that we'd spend entire afternoons reading in the library itself, losing track of time amidst the stacks. I immensely enjoyed this activity for several reasons. First, reading transported me to different worlds, allowed me to experience diverse perspectives, and ignite my imagination. I found this both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Secondly, it was a shared experience with my brother and our discussions about the books we read brought us closer. Lastly, reading fostered my curiosity and the love of learning which has remained with me throughout my life. Looking back, those afternoons spent reading were not only enjoyable but also played a significant role in shaping who I am today.\n- Yes, I have told many other people about this activity because I really love it and I enjoyed it and I want everyone to know and share about it.", "- They do trading business.\n- Yes, I think so.\n- I'm live in an apartment.", "- Because I think childhood for most of the people is a very happy memory because they don't worry about the future, they don't need to think that too much. I always saw that I think in the childhood people just can't be happy and when they grow up, they know that they need to learn and grow the pain. So childhood is a period that can nourish us.\n- Kids and I think kids are much more easier to be happy than adults because they don't need to think too much about their career, their job, their study or else they just be happy because they are alive. As adults, they always worry about the future or can't stay at the moment. So for many adults, they are very happy because they can be with the loved one and do the\n- In my view, in my opinion, many people still remember their classmates at primary school because they know their relationship at that time was very... they have a deep connection. They spend a lot of time together and had a good memory. So when he thinks about that person, it will make him feel happy. So he will remember that person as they're during their childhood. And also, now...", "- It's not so easy for me to manage time because I always don't know what I should do in Dota I want to do. So I often do something for the sudden ideas and then...\n- I don't know what the exact time that I found it is hard for me to allocate time. I think it's always for me difficult to manage my time well.\n- Sometimes I feel like a busy day makes me feel I am filled and I am not. Sometimes when I am so tired I want to be relaxed and not so busy I want to... I want to...", "- I'm a student so you mean the rest will be...\n- I only listen to the music even I have a rest. Actually I could watch some videos and play some games on computer or on smartphone. At the same time I will get some background music or some English or Japanese songs at the side. So it's a double side rest. Take a rest.\n- Sorry, I don't know the meaning of that book. Could you explain more about this topic?", "- Okay, thank you. Speaking of good news, I've heard about someone I know well. I'd like to share with you the real experience of a friend of mine. I mean, I'm so glad that he has gotten to the habit of having a healthy lifestyle. That's definitely a good news because I mean in the past the friend of mine didn't have a very healthy lifestyle, you know, such as sitting from the computer for too long or eating too much fast food or barbecue or maybe having an irregular bedtime staying up late at night things like that and the truth was that he wasn't really a sporty person. He was definitely a homebody and but things had completely changed since he had been using an app called Keep Rounding. I mean with using the app with the help of it, the friend of mine, he would love to share his rounds online and he even recommended this to me and saying that, oh, it's very handy to keep track of your speed, distance and calories. So by using this app, he has successfully lost his weight and by now he's been sticking to his running plan. He also invited me to join this jogging group. So I'm so proud of him and that's the piece of good news. I heard from him and that's basically what I like to talk about by now.\n- Yes for sure we have some common friends and we'd love to talk about this all the time. I mean it has completely changed a person.\n- Yes, social media offered us a very good platform where everyone would like to describe their mood, what they have been doing recently.

You can like work outside, work in the nature. It's very relaxed.\n- When I was a child, the favorite meeting place, I think it would be at the playground so that we can ride bicycles or just play together, have fun. But now I prefer to in the coffee shop because it's more like indoor, we more meet indoors because we can have more communications and it's a quiet place for us to talk.", "- Yeah, of course, I think it's definitely possible to have a break.\n- Yeah, there are more activities for young people now.\n- Yeah, I think most people can balance it.", "- You make all the work with the mouth.\n- I'm not sure.

You're going to be quite emotional when you are actually watching films and I don't think it's a good idea to show your emotional instability to other people.\n- I don't think so, especially I think kids at very young age, they were not suitable to watch movies in cinema. They were hard to discipline and control and they can be quite noisy in cinemas.\n- Okay, so when I was about 16 years old, I met this guy called Alexander who dressed unlike anyone I'd met before. I was in high school in Scotland at the time he and he just transferred to our school from England in a town in a town where I live. We didn't often meet many people from other countries, so we weren't familiar with other fashion styles. It was a real surprise when this new student from thousands of miles away arrived, dressed in clothes none of us have ever seen before. Alexander was of our age, of course, but he seemed like he was from another planet. He spoke differently and acted differently and, as I said, he dressed differently. For one thing, we all wore school uniform, but on his first day he didn't. He wore his normal street clothes. But normal for him, it wasn't exactly normal for most people. He had a weird style, but it worked for him. He mixed and matched colors that were bright and bold and he layered one type of clothing over another such as wearing a suit jacket over a vest with a tie but no collar. He was really unusual and everyone thought he was cool because of it. He also wore several different types of hats, even though hats weren't exactly in fashion back then. Still, wearing something that no one else wore just made him stick out even more. Most importantly, I think Alexander appeared confident in what he wore. I guess he just didn't care what others felt or perhaps he had special insights into what clothes would look good on him, even if they seemed unusual in many cases. He had a flair for picking out colors and combining clothes to give him his really unique appearance.", "- Yes, of course. I also public this story.\n- People's lack of trust in information on the internet can be attributed to several factors.

There are all kinds of snacks in the store. From ice cream to some delicious beverage and I always spend time with my friends hanging out in that store to buy some snacks for us to chill out.\n- Well, I think it really depends on the situation. Nowadays when I buy things I will always check the reviews no matter it's big company or small company. As long as the reviews are good I will buy the products. I don't really care about the size of the company.\n- Well, I think working in a big company is a double-edged sword. The downside of it is that there are too many competitions in big companies. But the good side is that you can have a lot more opportunities than working in a small company. So, I really think it depends on whether, like, which, like, working atmosphere you like.", "- Well cycling for this topic you know cycling is healthy low impact anxiety can be enjoyed by people of all ages from young children to elder. So it's also fun to engage for the environment. So today I will talk about a trick on which I went with my friend five years ago. I was lived in a hostel during school. We were three boys who shared a room and each one had a bicycle. So on that I used to go to school because our hostel was located outside the school. During the start of the winter we decided to go to Moraine for shopping and bicycles. We took permission from our hostel warden for an outing on the weekend. We took unnecessary riding gear like gloves, helmets and all bottles. We started our trip early in the morning. There were two villages on the way. After half an hour we stopped near the first village to rest and had a cup of tea. We started riding again after 15 minutes after covering wind kilometers. When my friend's cycle stopped because the cycle chain was broken. Luckily it had happened near a workshop. We went there and asked for help. The mechanic took 20 minutes and set the chain. We covered a distance of 18 kilometers within an hour and reached our destination. Even though we were all exhausted because we did not cover the longest distance before that. We enjoyed a lot. We did a shopping, clicked many pictures and had lunch. We came back to the hostel at about 4pm. So this is a really good activity because you want to leave it in healthy. You need to be physically active. Your physical activity can help protect your friend. A theory of disease such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness and diabetes. So riding bicycle is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of health problems.\n- No.\n- Yeah, absolutely. Like I said before, it was one of the best ways to exercise and stay fit. Cycling is not just an exercise for the legs rather than a complete cardiovascular workout. Even doctors or device people can commute using bicycles instead of driving a car. So in this way, people who live in a haptic lifestyle can manage a workout in their schedule without doing anything extra.", "- A comment, could you repeat your question?\n- Who do I live with?

However, my current favorite is definitely rock music. There's just something about the guitarists and energetic drum beats that really speak to me. I also like the fact that rock music can cover a wide range of emotions, from heavy angst to uplifting joy. So I never get bored of it.\n- Yes, I do enjoy visiting art galleries. I find them to be a rich source of inspiration and a wonderful way to explore and appreciate different artists' perspectives and styles. Beyond the enjoyment one can gain from viewing beautiful and thought-provoking artwork, I believe that galleries also provide an opportunity to learn about different cultures, time periods, and artistic movements.\n- While I have always had a deep appreciation for arts, I don't think I have the natural talent or inclination to be an artist myself. Instead, I prefer to channel my creativity in other ways, such as writing or photography. That being said, I have the utmost respect for those who pursue a career in arts and admire their ability to convey complex emotions and ideas through their work.", "- Of course, because I hate bad men when I was young, so I prefer to be a good policeman and I want to coach more and more criminal.\n- No, actually not.

However, there are certainly some types of music that I don't enjoy listening to as much. For example, I find some types of heavy metal to be a bit too intense for my taste.\n- Yes, I tend to listen to different types of music depending on my mood and what I am doing. Sometimes I listen to pop music to get energized, and other times I listen to jazz or classical music to relax.", "- Not a lot. I was not the kind of kid who saw snacks, but I do eat some snacks.\n- I think when I'm hungry, um, yeah, especially, uh, late in the night, um...\n- It depends on what I eat.

My parents bought me my first cycle when I was 10 years old and it helped me become more confident in myself.

We took unnecessary riding gear like gloves, helmets and all bottles. We started our trip early in the morning. There were two villages on the way. After half an hour we stopped near the first village to rest and had a cup of tea. We started riding again after 15 minutes after covering wind kilometers. When my friend's cycle stopped because the cycle chain was broken. Luckily it had happened near a workshop. We went there and asked for help. The mechanic took 20 minutes and set the chain. We covered a distance of 18 kilometers within an hour and reached our destination. Even though we were all exhausted because we did not cover the longest distance before that. We enjoyed a lot.

I have watched it many times and it never gets boring. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.", "- Well, I think it's really necessary and interesting process for children to know some different and various animals. And yeah, and you can make a chance to let them know and discuss different animals.

He's the founder of Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. I first learned about Jack Ma when I was studying business in college. He was often mentioned as a prominent figure in the Chinese tech industry. I became curious about his story and how he had achieved such remarkable success. Before he became famous, Jack Ma struggled with setbacks and rejections. He was rejected from many jobs and was even turned down by KFC when they opened up their first restaurant in China. Eventually, he founded Alibaba Group in 1999, I believe, which started out as an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers. What interests me most about Jack Ma is his perseverance and his commitment to social responsibility. He has faced many obstacles in his career but has always maintained a positive attitude and willingness to learn from his mistakes. Additionally, he has used his wealth and influence to give back to society, supporting courses such as environmental protection and education. In conclusion, I think Jack Ma is an inspiring figure who has made a significant impact on the Chinese tech industry and beyond.

As a fan of the original Wonder Woman movie, I was excited to see this sequel and the new storyline that he promised. The movie follows Diana Prince, also known as Wonder Woman, as the navigates life in the 1980s. The story revolves around a magical object that grants wishes which leads to chaos and destruction. While the primaries send it interesting, the execution felt short for me. I decided to watch this movie as I enjoyed the first one and was interested in seeing how the filmmakers would take the character in a few directions. However, I was disappointed by the uneven pacing, lackluster action scenes and at times cheesy dialogue. Moreover, I felt that the plot was convoluted and failed to establish clear stakes or consequences. This brought the strong performances of the cast, especially Gail Goodes, portrayal of Wonder Woman. There were too many unexplained and uncutting convincing plot points that left me feeling confused and underwhelmed.

I usually read alone, but sometimes my friends and I would exchange books and discuss our opinions about the characters and the storyline. It was a great way to share our love of reading and learn more about different genres and authors. I loved reading because it allowed me to escape reality and entering into different worlds and perspectives. I could travel to far off lands, meet interesting characters, and experience different cultures, all from the comfort of my own home. Reading also enhanced my imagination, vocabulary, and critical thinking skills, which proved beneficial later on in my life. Furthermore, reading was a fantastic stress reliever for me.

But nowadays, people were famous for many different reasons, like even those, well, even for some reasons that I found quite ridiculous because he or she did something that is, that seemed bizarre and weird, and that makes them famous. And well, like people just follow them for fun, for their stupidity.\n- Nowadays, I wouldn't say so. We have a lot of so-called actors and actresses famous for their face, their good-looking, but not their professional skill. They were not good at acting at all.

And you can stand on the shoulders of giants and in the end you will be a better person.\n- Yes, I would say actually not often go to Zooms, but I occasionally go to Zooms. I kind of enjoy it and really depends on like how much the Zoo managers dedicate their time to enrich the experience of the visitors. Some zoos just have sporadic animals spreading around the zoos. So you just take a look and the environment is dirty. So in this case, I don't really like the zoos, but there are other zoos where, you know, it's, there is a plethora of animals and you can really see them enjoying their lives. Sometimes there are some entertainment activities within the zoos which can increase, you know, your experience as a visitor. And also this could be controversial, but if there are some, if there are some performance with that, you know, performance by the animals like tires and they're just doing some difficult tasks with the human trainer. Although some people would argue that's unethical and inhumane to train the animals this way because they must have experienced very hard treatment in order to achieve that level of perform, performant behavior. But I still think that as a visitor from a visitor's perspective, it's a perfect zoo experience.\n- Well, how often I would go to the Zeus maybe every year and that's it because there's no incentive to, if you're not moving to another city, there's no meaning to repeatedly go to the same zoo in a city because it's usually constantly stay the same. And even if you're good to the other cities, which is not too often in my case, the Zeus oftentimes won't be the first choice. And that's also the case if you're good to the big cities, if you go to a smaller cities or the countryside or just want to go to a remote place to see the landscapes, then it's unlikely that you will go to Zeus. So overall, people have the less tendency to go to Zeus, so it's not that often I would say overall on average for the general population.", "- For example, play games with classmates. Go to games. It's very popular.\n- I like English because I think in English it is very important for me. I plan to study abroad next year. So English is important for me.\n- Do you have any good teachers?

He invited me to play together. And we played all day in the daytime. And when we went back home, he invited me to visit his house. So we promised each other. One day, we'll invite each other to visit his home. So maybe you think it's a simple promise. But for me, in the daytime, I need to be more and more brave to promise him.

I was in high school in Scotland at the time he and he just transferred to our school from England in a town in a town where I live. We didn't often meet many people from other countries, so we weren't familiar with other fashion styles. It was a real surprise when this new student from thousands of miles away arrived, dressed in clothes none of us have ever seen before. Alexander was of our age, of course, but he seemed like he was from another planet. He spoke differently and acted differently and, as I said, he dressed differently. For one thing, we all wore school uniform, but on his first day he didn't. He wore his normal street clothes. But normal for him, it wasn't exactly normal for most people. He had a weird style, but it worked for him. He mixed and matched colors that were bright and bold and he layered one type of clothing over another such as wearing a suit jacket over a vest with a tie but no collar. He was really unusual and everyone thought he was cool because of it. He also wore several different types of hats, even though hats weren't exactly in fashion back then. Still, wearing something that no one else wore just made him stick out even more. Most importantly, I think Alexander appeared confident in what he wore. I guess he just didn't care what others felt or perhaps he had special insights into what clothes would look good on him, even if they seemed unusual in many cases. He had a flair for picking out colors and combining clothes to give him his really unique appearance.\n- No, I haven't. It's just a past old classmate, so I don't believe he's really that special.\n- Well, I do believe it's important in some extent, but not that important because people can wear any kind of clothes he or she wears without people actually commenting on what he or she is wearing, no matter if it's fashionable or not.

I was fortunate to have a small library near my house which became my sanctuary. My brother and I would go there at least once a week carrying home arm loads of books that we'd devour over the coming days. Our reading interests were diverse, ranging from fantasy and adventure, novels to books on science, history, and biographies of inspiring individuals. We were insatiable and the library's vast collection never disappointed us. Sometimes we'd get so engrossed in our books that we'd spend entire afternoons reading in the library itself, losing track of time amidst the stacks. I immensely enjoyed this activity for several reasons. First, reading transported me to different worlds, allowed me to experience diverse perspectives, and ignite my imagination. I found this both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Secondly, it was a shared experience with my brother and our discussions about the books we read brought us closer. Lastly, reading fostered my curiosity and the love of learning which has remained with me throughout my life. Looking back, those afternoons spent reading were not only enjoyable but also played a significant role in shaping who I am today.\n- Yes, I have told many other people about this activity because I really love it and I enjoyed it and I want everyone to know and share about it.\n- Well, undoubtedly taking regular breaks during work or studies of paramount importance and has multifaceted benefits that span cognitive function, creativity, productivity, mental well-being, and physical health. To begin with, let's delve into the cognitive and productivity aspects. The human brain, self-sophisticated as it is, wasn't designed for extended periods of intense focus and cognitive processing. Such as the study by Desktime, one of the most productive employees, productivity tracking software companies, suggests that the most productive people working for 52 minutes and then take a break for 17 minutes. The model aligns with the notion of ultra-dien rhythms, natural body cycles occurring multiple times in a 24-hour day. During each cycle, there is a peak when we are most alert and at 12 when we are exhausted. Respecting these rhythms by taking breaks can help maintain optimal cognitive function. Additionally, taking breaks faster, creativity, when you step away from a task, you allow your mind to wander and make connections that might not make when you are deeply focused. This so-called diffusion thinking can lead to innovative solutions and creative insights. On the mental health front, working or studying without breaks can lead to stress, burnout, and feelings of overwhelm. Regular breaks, especially ones involving relaxation or activities that bring joy, can significantly reduce stress levels and foster a sense of well-being. From a physical perspective, prolonged sitting or screen time can contribute to various health issues including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and computer vision syndrome. Taking breaks to move around combats the sedentary lifestyle risks and promotes better physical health. Finally, breaks also play a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. During breaks, the brain has time to consolidate new knowledge and skills which is a vital part of the learning process. To maximize benefits of breaks, it is best to combine different types of activities such as physical movement, relaxation techniques, and even short periods of mindfulness or meditation. Some people find the promoteral technique helpful which involves focused work of a period of 25 minutes into spurred with 5 minutes breaks. In conclusion, far from being a sign of idle news or wasted time, breaks are an essential component of effective work or study habits. They help maintain and even boost productivity, creativity, and overall well-being. Therefore, incorporating regular structured breaks into the work or study routine is highly advisable.", "- I would love to see a gorilla in the wild.

Ideally, I would like to plan my trip during the summer months of June to August, when the weather is mild and the days are longer, giving me more time to explore everything Iceland has to offer. I would like to book a flight there and then rent a car once I arrive, so that I can have more flexibility and control over my itinerary.

He would cook the big meal for whole family, sometimes relatives would come and eat with us as well. There are more than 10 different dishes. They all taste different and but delicious. Like I said, obviously my dad supports the meal and although my mom and sometimes I would also help, we usually just eat at home and yes that's where he would cook it and that's how we enjoy it. The meal I talked about, I have been talking about, was the last one before I went above. That's why I remember it so well.", "- Well, in the past time, I still didn't think about it, but in the future, I may create my own website because I also learned related information like the HTML language to create the website.

This helps me feel more alert and productive during the day.\n- Now, I didn't stay up late very often when I was a child. My parents were strict about reinforcing a consistent bedtime schedule so that I could get enough rest for school. However, there were rare occasions, such as during holidays or special events, when I was allowed to stay up a bit later than usual.\n- When I stay up late, I usually spend my time reading a book, catching up on a TV show, or chatting with friends online.

I enjoyed reading adventure stories because it's full of imagination, adventure, courage, and heroes. And the other reason I enjoyed it is when I was in Little Kate, my parents read a lot of stories for me. So I am a big fan of stories. I read in my home and library because you know when my parents couldn't buy the whole adventure stories for me. And the library actually has had a lot of those books. So I went to library every weekend. After I read those books and stories, I would share those stories with my friends. And one of them I remember, she was a teenager. She also found out adventure stories. So she went to library with me. Maybe one third time. And I think reading adventure stories actually told me a lot.

So I have questions about how to practice speaking English, speaking skills.

And even for the entire world, like for the country, the United States, where I'm living right now, the Chinese food is one of the most popular food types, and it's really very influential. So I would say the Chinese people have created a deep culture about eating and about food. So the answer to your question is yes, of course.\n- Well actually to reverse some of the points that I made earlier and I think deeper about it, I believe nowadays there are more fast food, more processed food that's more accessible at lower expenses for people. So people do have the option to eat more unhealthy if they don't have enough self-control. But on the other hand, there are much more healthy and affordable food and fruits available for people. So I think for the vast majority of people with the knowledge that they can eat more healthy as well.", "- If you're talking about China, over the past 10, 20 years over my lifetime, it has changed significantly. Before, it was more suburban feeding, and now there are a lot of new buildings. In Hangzhou, the two sides of the river used to be very desert, like a forest or a desert.

In the past, you know, we only have a phone or a mail. It doesn't really bother you that much because you expect to be caught upon at any moment, but now we have a cell phone. Your phone seems to be constantly ringing, not only from text messages, apps, but also from notifications of different websites and apps. So I think, yeah, it's a major source of distraction. And also sometimes your phone just calling around you, you know, trying to trick you to using it, to watch a video or something. So that also is a distraction, but I think it's not as much as the notifications that's bugging me quite a lot.\n- I think one way to be focused or to concentrate is basically to shut off all communications turn off a cell phone, turn off the computer, if you're not using it of course. Basically you have to get into this mindset where you just tell yourself that nothing is going to distract me from doing what I'm doing right now. So I think it's one of the mind things, it's more the control, psychological control you have rather than physical technique.\n- Well, it's not very difficult for me because I want to do things that interest me. So if I'm interested in it, basically I just look, let's get lost and toss myself. So it's not hard for me, per se, but I think it's hard for a lot of people now and then with the apps again, more interesting with the algorithm than with them just trying to to trick you into watching videos that are similar to your likes. So I think it's hard for a lot of people, but personally I think it's not that hard for me.", "- I am here because I need them. If you leave the room, there is no bed.

You're going to be quite emotional when you are actually watching films and I don't think it's a good idea to show your emotional instability to other people.\n- I don't think so, especially I think kids at very young age, they were not suitable to watch movies in cinema. They were hard to discipline and control and they can be quite noisy in cinemas.", "- When I was in, I used a software called TestimQ2, and it's formed by the Testim company in 1998.

Because many users they sent me a link and help them to cut something by them. Because if I cut something for them they will reduce the funds of their products. So I hate everybody sending me a link and let me help them. It's a trouble.", "- Oh well, it's hard to choose because I love both, yeah, but if I have to say maybe the modern house is the right fit for me, yeah, you know, because I'm studying in the city center and some modern cities always near them and are suited in the city center.

So I always want to see it and take some photos about it.\n- In fact, I'm not a coffee maniac, so in fact, I haven't noticed some coffee shops. When I take a work with my classmates during the rest and we just hang out, by accident we found a really beautiful and unique coffee shop and then we went into it. At first, I feel a little interested in about it, but I want to try something to test some delicious snacks. Then I order some snacks and coffee. What's surprising is that the snacks and coffee in this coffee shop were really delicious and yummy. You can say that it impressed me a lot and changed my mind about coffee shops. From then on, we always went to there and tested some special coffee shop. In fact, I can't remember how time we went to there about three times a week.

They used to be worry-free and they have planted of leisure time, which are something they'd only have for now, because adults and maybe university students, young people, they have limits of leisure time that they can take control of. So they will always feel that childhood is a great...\n- I don't think so. What I feel about this question is actually children and adults would share different types of happiness. For children their happiness is more like to secret dopamine from the brain. They would feel happy of some simple things like buying a new toy or having dinner in a new restaurant. But for adults they would probably feel delighted when they accomplish their goals or achieve their dreams.\n- Because back in the primary school time, people wouldn't spend much effort on suffering from making new friends and they didn't have so many things to concern about, like the gap between the rich and poor and between boys and girls. So the childhood friendship was actually innocent. But for now, most people just they're worried a lot when they make new friends and they even have social phobia.", "- It also makes it easier to carry in additional items I might need, like an umbrella or water bottle.

You know, take a nap, take a nap, rest.", "- I do go to cinema very often now but not really often as a child. That is because I grew up in a very small town. We don't have much resources of entertainment including watching films. Another reason is that I couldn't afford myself to watch films. The only experiences of watching films in cinema is the only occasions that was organized by our school.\n- I definitely enjoy watching movies with my friends because we share similar habits and we share similar tastes on movies but I wouldn't choose to go to cinemas with my parents. They would react literally different when we see the same movie and we don't share anything similar in terms of movie choices.\n- It depends on the film whether it is the new one or the old one that I have been watched for several times. If it's a new one, I would go to the cinema and enjoy the large screen and wonderful sound and the fact because the equipment in the theatre is better.
